1. Please review the code, add your comments to improve the code.
2. If you are familiar with serverless framework then using serverless offline, add the option to run this code locally. If you are not familiar with serverless framework then add express to run this code locally.
3. Add a new service that can be accessed via REST URI /echo which takes a string as parameter and return a json containing the same string. For example:
/echo?q='hello world'   and it returns { q= 'hello world' } (This is just an example you can return any json containing the string.)
4. Ensure that there are adequate unit tests for the newly written code.
